This is a desktop based (client/server) Automatic Car Parking system that assigns slots to cars, the project incorporates Sqlite3 database system to record events and entities. It is entirely written in Python and the Graphic User Interface was designed with Tkinter library. The application collects plate numbers as a unique identifier and assigns an equally unique slot number to the vehicle. At the car's exit, total time parked is calculated and the bill is automatically generated.
